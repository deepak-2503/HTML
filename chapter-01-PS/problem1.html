    In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system
    for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing
    an Internet-based hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in
    late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request
    for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed
    "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.
